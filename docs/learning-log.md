# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Alyssa Guzman  
**Date:** October 22, 2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned how to manage repositories in GitHub, including creating, organizing, and maintaining project files. I also gained a better understanding of how to use Issues to track tasks, report bugs, and assign responsibilities, which helps teams collaborate more efficiently and stay organized. Additionally, I learned why documentation is so important in open source projects. It provides clear guidance for contributors, ensures consistency, and helps others understand how to use or build upon the project.

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge I faced was getting used to editing and creating files directly on GitHub as I usually do my changes on my local computer and push the changes through the terminal. I followed the instructions accordingly and I now know how to manage my files directly on GitHub. 

## Connection to My GIS Career
GitHub skills will help me in my GIS career by allowing me to showcase my projects and analysis workflows in a professional portfolio that others can access. It will also make it easier to collaborate with other analysts or developers on open source geospatial tools and datasets. Understanding version control ensures I can manage my code and documentation efficiently as my projects progress.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
